```bash
go get -u github.com/ptti-app/ptti-helper@v0.0.2
```

This is just a helper function for reusability between ptti go services.

Feel free to make changes and create a pull request. I'm sure this code is shit for now,
but can be improve overtime whether its optimization or better use case scenario.
